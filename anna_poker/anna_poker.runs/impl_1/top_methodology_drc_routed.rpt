LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/oserdes_m_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) vga_to_hdmi/inst/encg/dout_reg[9]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/cnt_reg[1]/CLR, vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/cnt_reg[2]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/cnt_reg[3]/CLR, vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/cnt_reg[4]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[0]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[1]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[2]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[3]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[4]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[5]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[6]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[7]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[8]/CLR,
vga_to_hdmi/inst/encr/dout_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 42 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk_100 -waveform {0.000 5.000} [get_ports Clk] (Source: C:/Poker/graphics/pin_assignment/mb_usb_hdmi_top.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports Clk] (Source: c:/Poker/anna_poker/anna_poker.gen/sources_1/ip/clk_wiz_0/clk_wiz_0.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 11 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
